Open Source Electromagnetic Trackers
====================================

Goals of the Project
--------------------

To teach the process of developing electromagnetic trackers for research, to foster an open community of researchers developing electromagnetic trackers, to develop open-source software and open-source hardware for working research electromagnetic trackers interfacing to Slicer through [OpenIGTLink](http://openigtlink.org/).
